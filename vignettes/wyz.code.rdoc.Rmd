Package **`r pkn`** aims to generate **R documentation**(manual pages) directly from
offensive programming instrumentation. 

Read [Offensive programming book](https://neonira.github.io/offensiveProgrammingBook/) to get introduction and advanced knowledge on the topic. Main chapter related to [documentation generation](https://neonira.github.io/offensiveProgrammingBook/generating-r-documentation.html) might be of first interest.
